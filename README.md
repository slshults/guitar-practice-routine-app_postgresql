# Guitar Practice Routine Assistant

A web app for guitar players to manage practice routines, create chord charts, and track practice progress. 
This version uses PostgreSQL as the database backend.

**Note**: If you prefer a slower Google Sheets-based version (no local database required), check out the [original Google Sheets version](https://github.com/slshults/guitar-practice-routine-app_sheets).

## Feature Highlights

### Practice Session Management
- **Timer-based practice sessions** with customizable durations for each item
- **Progress tracking** - mark items as complete during practice
- **Organized routines** with drag-and-drop reordering
- **Visual progress indicators** showing completion status
- **Drag n drop** to rearrange items in a routine

### Chord Chart System
- **Interactive chord chart editor** with click-to-place finger positions
- **Section organization** - organize chords by song sections (Verse, Chorus, etc.)
- **SVGuitar integration** for professional chord diagram rendering
- **Autocreate feature** - upload PDFs or images, or paste the URL for a YouTube lesson video, to automatically generate chord charts using Claude AI
- **Shared chord charts** - charts can be used on multiple instances of the same song (for different focus during different practice routines)
- **CommonChords database** 12,700+ pre-defined chord patterns, and/or create your own

### Data Management
- **PostgreSQL database** - reliable, fast local storage
- **Complete CRUD operations** for routines, items, and chord charts
- **Section metadata** stored within chord data for organization
- **Cross-platform support** - works on Windows (WSL2), macOS, and Linux
- **Local songbook folder links** - quick access to files on your local from links in the app

### Optional auto-creation of chord charts with help from Claude AI
- **Autocreate chord charts** from lyrics sheets with chord names, existing chord charts, or YouTube lesson URLs
- **Three processing paths**: Visual chord diagrams, chord names above lyrics, and tablature notation
- **Smart model selection** - optimized for accuracy and cost efficiency. local OCR is used to pull info from lyrics sheets with chord names and send it ot Sonnet 4 to pull the chords from a the DB. chord charts visually analyzed by Opus 4.1 who sends the results to Sonnet 4 for chord chart creation 
- **Optional feature** - requires Anthropic API key

### Track your practice time, in-depth
- **PostHog analytics built-in** - optional practice history tracking via PostHog. Works with the free level, project API key required.

   ```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start both Flask server and Vite watcher
./gpr.sh

# Or run components separately:
# Backend only:
python run.py
# Frontend build watcher:
npm run watch
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

Leave a comment if you run into errors. (Can't guarantee any support though, this is a hobby project.)

## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:

- **`items`** - Practice items (songs, exercises, techniques)
- **`routines`** - Practice routine collections, made up of items
- **`routine_items`** - Junction table linking routines to items
- **`chord_charts`** - Chord diagrams with section organization
- **`active_routine`** - Tracks currently selected routine
- **`common_chords`** - Database of 12,700+ predefined chord patterns

### Demo Data

The application includes demo data to get you started:

- **Sample routine**: "Songs" with one practice item
- **Sample song**: "For What It's Worth" with E, D, A, A7 chord charts
- **Organized sections**: Chords grouped by song section (Chorus)
- **Local folder path**: Example songbook folder path structure

The complete schema and demo data are provided in `schema.sql` and `demo_data.sql` files.

## Architecture

### Backend (Flask + PostgreSQL)
- **Flask application** with RESTful API endpoints
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** with PostgreSQL database
- **Service layer** for logic (ItemService, ChordChartService, etc.)
- **Repository layer** for data access and management

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **React 18.2.0** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite 4.x** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **SVGuitar integration** for chord diagram rendering
- **Path aliases** (`@components`, `@hooks`, `@ui`, etc.)

### Key Components
- `PracticePage.jsx` - Main practice session interface
- `ChordChartEditor.jsx` - Interactive chord diagram editor
- `ChordGrid.jsx` - Chord chart display component
- `DataLayer` - Database abstraction and service layer

## API Endpoints

### Items
- `GET /api/items` - List all practice items
- `POST /api/items` - Create new item
- `GET /api/items/<id>` - Get item details
- `PUT /api/items/<id>` - Update item
- `DELETE /api/items/<id>` - Delete item

### Routines  
- `GET /api/routines` - List all routines
- `POST /api/routines` - Create new routine
- `GET /api/routines/<id>` - Get routine with items
- `PUT /api/routines/<id>` - Update routine
- `DELETE /api/routines/<id>` - Delete routine

### Chord Charts
- `GET /api/items/<id>/chord-charts` - Get chord charts for item
- `POST /api/items/<id>/chord-charts` - Create chord chart
- `PUT /api/chord-charts/<id>` - Update chord chart
- `DELETE /api/chord-charts/<id>` - Delete chord chart
- `POST /api/autocreate-chord-charts` - AI-powered chord chart creation

## Usage Tips

### Start with items
- **Create items**: on the `Items` page. Create some of your own, or start with the included "For What It's Worth" example (Chorus only included, to avoid copyright complaints)
  - **Local folders**: optional: set songbook paths to link to your guitar files
- **Create a routine**: on the Routines page, or start with the include demo routine. Add items to your routine, drag and drop to reorder
- **Set an active routine**: It'll show up on the `Practice` page

### Practice
- **Use timers** to track practice duration for each item
- **Mark items complete** as you finish them
- **Chord charts** Create or view by expanding the chord chart section in an item

### Chord Chart Management
1. **Toggle "Add New Chord"** to open the interactive editor
2. **Click on fret positions** to place fingers
3. **Organize chords by sections** (Verse, Chorus, etc.)
4. **Use autocreate** to generate charts from PDFs or images
5. **Copy chord charts** between songs (useful if you focus on different aspects of a song in different routines. Just create multiple items for that song, for use in different routines)
